# Task Manager Upadate
The previous Capstone project II, was a simple task management system that stored data in text files. This project, has been modified to use lists , dictionaries and functions to extend the functionality of the previous Capstone Project.

## The following functions have been added :
- ‘r’ to register a user.
- ‘a’ to add a new task.
- ‘va’ to view all the tasks listed in ‘tasks.txt’.
- ‘vm’ to view all the tasks that have been assigned to them.

- A new option called 'gr'- generate reports has been added to the main menu of the application. 
When the user chooses to generate reports, two text files, called task_overview.txt and user_overview.txt, should be generated. 

- A new option called 'ds' - display statistics
Allows the admin to display statistics so that the reports generated are read from task _overview.txt and user_overview.txt
